# solver
Implements solvers for linear equations in python.
The solution methods that I implemented include Conjugate Gradient,
Successive over-relaxation, Jocabi Iteration, Gauss Seidel.
The solver is correctly set up to solve a deterization of Laplace's equation.
However, it could be modified without much difficulty to solve
a different PDE.
